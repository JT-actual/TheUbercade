# The Ubercade
Raspberry Pi 3 Super Nintendo / Vertical Scrolling Arcade project for entertaining your rideshare customers & earning more tips.


## November 2023 Update
This project has been massively overhauled since its inception in 2018. The 2018 instruction set contained a bunch of workarounds and custom python scripting to get it to work. 
The team at Raspberry Pi have since added an install option for Retropie which makes this project nearly turn-key. To make this more accessible to others, I have updated the instructions to reflect the new process. You will find all instructions necessary to build this for yourself on this page.


## The Problem

The year is 2018. Location: Denver. Over the previous three months I had wrapped up my first contract with the Defense Department, purchased a home in a city I had only ever been to once, and moved across the country with my wife and our pup, Krixus. Life was good. The only thing missing? Work.

As I rounded out my time with the DoD, I picked up another contract with Homeland Security. That contract, however, left me with a 4-month gap in between. So, in search of a patch-over, I decided to drive weekends with Uber & Lyft. A side hustle absent any form of glitz or glam but a positive experience over all. If only it paid as well as I thought it would.


## The Solution

I did the math: I was making about $8 an hour after all expenses were paid. Not great, but better than ripping through my savings waiting for my next contract to start or starting another job just to quit a couple months later. 

I started brainstorming ways to increase my side hustle's income- complimentary water and gum, free and paid snacks, letting the passenger control the Spotify, free stops at convenience stores, going offline in the city and going back online near the airport to optimize for airport-only trips, etc. Most of the ideas were geared toward enhancing the riders experience and, in return, increasing the likelihood a rider would leave a tip (or a larger one.) Those ideas weren't exceptional though. There was no wow factor. It was appreciated and 5-star review worthy, sure, but not an "OMG, can we book you to drive us again?!" type of experience.

So, I started thinking a bit out of the box and also thinking more about my customer and what they really wanted. I worked the bar shift. 6pm-3am, Thus-Sat. As such, the majority of my riders were usually in their early 20s to early 40s. Many of them working in tech, finance or an adjacent industry. I had heard of other drivers with in-car karaoke that did really well, but that was... not something I was willing to subject myself to. Ultimately I landed on building a Super Nintendo / Vertical Scrolling Arcade for the back seat of my 2014 Ford Focus.


## The Objective & The Result

The objective of this project was very rudimentary: make more money. The tangible result of this project was phenomenal. The intangible result; even better. 

All told, this project took me less than one day to build and in the ~3 short months of running The Ubercade part-time, I received a total of 99 5-star reviews and was able to increase my tips from an average of $2.77 per trip to a staggering $6.70 per trip- a 142% increase, overnight.

The extra money was fantastic, but this project had one big (mega) upside that I did not plan for- it made this work actually enjoyable for me. Before, it was a bit monotonous. Lots of quiet, awkward drives with some interesting conversation sprinkled in every now and then. Once The Ubercade was on scene? Not the case.

Most of my riders were ECSTATIC to spend their ride reliving their childhood, playing games like Mario Kart, Street Fighter, & Pacman. This led to a huge increase in tips, but this also opened other doors, including a handful of folks that would pay a premium to book rides with me personally, a couple guys that paid me $100 just to stay parked at their house and let them play for an hour, and even a job offer. Above all, it made this work which I considered to otherwise be a pretty brutal grind a really fun experience in the end.

Now I'll show you how I did it, for under $100.


## Bill of Materials

1x Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 (I had a 3B+ laying around, but you should go with a newer model. As of this update (Nov 2023) the install process is the same across all 3 models.) <br>
1x Computer Monitor w/ Sound + HDMI Por t<br>
1x HDMI Cable + Power Cable for Monitor & RPI3 <br>
1x SD Card (A good one- you will need it for running SNES. Minimum UHS II, but go with III if you can afford) <br>
1x 16GB+ USB Stick (bigger = more games) <br>
1x DC Plug + USB -> Micro USB Power Cord (don't skimp here, if your power is low/unstable your RPI will have lagging issues or shut off entirely) <br>
2x SNES Controllers (Amazon) <br>
1x An Afternoon <br>
1-10x Beer(s) (optional) <br>
